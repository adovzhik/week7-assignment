# Final Project

## Name
Random Recipes
#
## Elevator Pitch
Do you ever have a single ingredient in your fridge that you don't know what to do with? Tired of making the same dish night after night? 

With the Random Recipes app, you can search by ingredient to find new recipes from a large database. Search results will be displayed, and there will be an option to save recipes for viewing later. This app is designed for anyone looking for cooking inspiration or curious how multiple ingredients can be combined into a unique dish.
